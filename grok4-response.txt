Certainly! To improve the efficiency, you should avoid executing a separate query inside the loop. Instead, you can perform a join between `QuestionAttempt` and `Question` and use SQL aggregation functions to count total attempts and correct attempts per topic in a single query.

Here's a more efficient version of your `CalculateUserTopicAccuracy` function:

```go
func CalculateUserTopicAccuracy(db *gorm.DB, userID uuid.UUID) (map[string]float64, error) {
	// Define a temporary struct to hold the aggregation results
	type Result struct {
		Topic       string
		Total       int64
		Correct     int64
	}

	var results []Result

	// Perform a join between QuestionAttempt and Question, grouping by Topic
	err := db.Table("question_attempts").
		Select("questions.topic, COUNT(*) as total, SUM(CASE WHEN question_attempts.is_correct THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as correct").
		Joins("JOIN questions ON questions.id = question_attempts.question_id").
		Where("question_attempts.user_id = ?", userID).
		Group("questions.topic").
		Scan(&results).Error

	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	accuracies := make(map[string]float64)
	for _, res := range results {
		if res.Total > 0 {
			accuracies[res.Topic] = (float64(res.Correct) / float64(res.Total)) * 100
		}
	}

	return accuracies, nil
}

```

### Key improvements:

- Uses a single SQL query with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`) to gather all data at once.
- Eliminates the per-attempt queries, reducing database round-trips significantly.
- Handles all calculations efficiently within the database engine.

This approach should enhance performance especially with larger datasets.

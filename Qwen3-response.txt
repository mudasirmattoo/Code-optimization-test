You're absolutely right â€” the original `CalculateUserTopicAccuracy` function is inefficient because it performs **N+1 queries**: one to get the attempts, and then one `db.First()` query **per attempt** to fetch the associated `Question` just to get the `Topic`.

We can optimize this dramatically using a **single SQL query** with a **JOIN**, leveraging GORM's ability to perform aggregations and group results.

Hereâ€™s the **highly efficient version** of `CalculateUserTopicAccuracy` that uses **only one database query**:

```go
func CalculateUserTopicAccuracy(db *gorm.DB, userID uuid.UUID) (map[string]float64, error) {
	type Result struct {
		Topic    string
		Total    int64
		Correct  int64
	}

	var results []Result
	// Single query with JOIN and aggregation
	if err := db.
		Table("question_attempts").
		Joins("JOIN questions ON questions.id = question_attempts.question_id").
		Select(`
			questions.topic AS topic,
			COUNT(*) AS total,
			SUM(CASE WHEN question_attempts.is_correct THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS correct
		`).
		Where("question_attempts.user_id = ?", userID).
		Group("questions.topic").
		Scan(&results).Error; err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// Convert to map of topic -> accuracy percentage
	accuracies := make(map[string]float64)
	for _, r := range results {
		accuracies[r.Topic] = (float64(r.Correct) / float64(r.Total)) * 100
	}

	return accuracies, nil
}

```

### âœ… Key Improvements:

- **Single Query**: Uses `JOIN` between `question_attempts` and `questions` to get topic info directly.
- **Aggregation in DB**: Uses `COUNT` and `SUM(CASE ...)` to compute totals and correct counts **per topic**.
- **Grouping**: Groups by `topic` so we get one row per topic.
- **No Loop Queries**: Eliminates all `db.First()` calls inside loops.
- **Efficient Memory Use**: Only loads final aggregated data into Go.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:

- Assumes your table names are pluralized as `"question_attempts"` and `"questions"` (GORM default).
- If you've customized table names via `TableName()` method, ensure they match.
- The `Scan(&results)` is used because we're selecting aggregated fields, not full models.

### Example Output (with your test data):

```go
Accuracies by Topic: map[Algebra:66.66666666666666 Calculus:100]

```

Which is correct:

- **Algebra**: 2 attempts, 1 correct â†’ 50%? Wait â€” let's double-check your test data:

```go
attempts := []QuestionAttempt{
    {UserID: userID, QuestionID: 1, IsCorrect: true},    // Algebra
    {UserID: userID, QuestionID: 1, IsCorrect: false},   // Algebra
    {UserID: userID, QuestionID: 2, IsCorrect: true},    // Calculus
    {UserID: userID, QuestionID: 3, IsCorrect: true},    // Algebra
}

```

Wait â€” QuestionID 1 and 3 are **both Algebra** â†’ 3 Algebra attempts:

- Correct: Q1 (true), Q1 (false), Q3 (true) â†’ 2 correct
- So Algebra: 2/3 â‰ˆ 66.67%
- Calculus: 1/1 = 100%

âœ… Matches expected.

### Final Thoughts

This optimized version scales well even with thousands of attempts, as all processing is done in the database engine efficiently
